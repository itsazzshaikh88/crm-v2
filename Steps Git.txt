✍️ Step 4: Make and Push Changes from 160
Make code changes or add files.

Track and commit:


git status
git add .
git commit -m "Changes from 160"
git pull --rebase origin main
git push origin main

🔄 Step 5: Sync Back to Azz
On Azz:

cd path/to/your-repo
git pull origin main
Now Azz is in sync with 160 and GitHub.

✅ ✅ Future Workflow (Azz & 160)
Use these rules every time before & after coding on either machine.

✔️ Before you start work (on Azz or 160):

git pull origin main
✔️ After you're done coding:

git add .
git commit -m "Your changes"
git pull --rebase origin main   # Ensures you're synced
git push origin main
